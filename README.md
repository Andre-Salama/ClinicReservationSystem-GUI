# ClinicReservationSystem-GUI

* This project was done using Java, and it's a GUI version of the project.
* A similar project was made as a [DOS program](https://github.com/Andre-Salama/ClinicReservationSystem-DOS).
* This project was done by me and my colleagues at the university as part of a module's project. Modules were basically subjects we had to learn, in case you're not familiar with the term.

This project may or may not receive updates, to better reflect my own skills in programming (and fix some errors that I'm aware are present in at least 2 files), since not all parts were done by me (Some were done by my colleagues of course).
